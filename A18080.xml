            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The A.

For albeit it can not be / but that which is not agreable vnto the worde off God / is againſt the worde off God: and off the otherſide / that which is not againſt the worde off God / is agreable vnto yt: yet he that ſo ſaithe / that certaine thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges muſt be doone not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the worde / that he wil not alſo accorde / that they ſhould be doone accordinge to the worde: gyuethe thereby to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand / that there is ſome ſtar or light off reaſon / or learninge or other helpe / whereby ſome act may be well doone / and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably vnto God / in which the worde off God was ſhut out / and not called to counſaile: as that which either coulde not / or neede not / giue any direction in that behalfe.

                        <hi>Epheſ,</hi> 2.</note> the Iewes / and Gentils. The Ceremoniall lawe therefore / beinge a lawe of enimitie (which as a wall held owt the Gentils / from ioyning them ſelues vnto the Iewes) was neceſſary amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt other cawſes / in this reſpect / to be taken away. The curſe off the lawe / for the breache of any the lawes of god / ether perteining to the Iewes in tymes paſt or vnto vs nowe / being that which maketh the wall betwene the Lord and vs: was for our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with his maieſtie / neceſſarily to be remoued. Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon followeth / firſt that the morall lawe (as that which nether hindereth our reconciliation with the Lord / not our good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with men) is in as full ſtrenght as euer it was before the comming of our Sauiour Chriſt. For the curſe off the lawe / beſide that it is in regard off the elect / rather fulfilled / and executed in the perſone off our Sa. Chriſt / then abrogated: beſide that alſo / yt hath a neceſſary vſe as yet towardes the elect / not onely to driue them to the faith which is in Chriſt Ieſus / but alſo to kepe vnder the remantes of rebellion / euen of them which haue already bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and beſide that the force thereoff / is daily / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſhalbe for euer / execured vpon the wicked: beſide all this / ſeing this curſe was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed / not onely to the breache off the morall lawe / but alſo off the Ceremoniall / and Iudiciall: there is no iuſte cauſe why the morall lawe ſhould be ſayde to be abrogated. At the leaſt / it can not ſtand (which the Anſ. hathe very daungerouſly ſet downe) that <hi>the whole lawe off god generally is abrogated.</hi> For if a man will make the curſe a
<pb n="XCVII" facs="tcp:7985:65"/> part of all the morall lawe / wher yt is rather a neceſſary adioinct / vnto the breache of the lawe / then a part therof: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding / that part off the morall lawe which ſtandeth in commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and forbidding / remaineth vnſhaken / and as concerning ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation / vntowched off our Sa. Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly / it foloweth hereuppon / that thoſe iudiciall lawes off Moſes / which are merely politik / and withowt all mixture off Ceremonies / muſt remaine / as thoſe which hinder not / the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment off the Iewes / and Gentils with God / or off one off them / with an other. Beſide that / it being manifeſt / that our Sa Chriſt came not / to diſſolue any Good gouernement off commen weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the: he can leaſt off all be thowght / to haue comme to diſſolue that which him ſelffe had eſtabliſhed. And off this point / the Anſ. hath twoo contrary ſentences: one off Muſculus / which ſaith / that <hi>the iudiciall lavve is abrogated,</hi> the other off Beza / which is the ſame with that which I haue brought reaſons off: that is to ſay / that <hi>the iudiciall lavve being giuen vnto the Ievves, is not</hi>

                     <hi>yet abrogated, ſo that iff they had any eſtate off common vveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, in the Land off Canaan, they ſhould be conſtreined, to vſe that forme off gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vvhich vvas gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Nowe albeit thoſe lawes / gyuen vnto the Iewes for that land doo not binde the Gentils in other landes / for ſomuche as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie off the diſpoſition of the people / and ſtate off that country gaue occaſion off ſome lawes there / which would not haue bene in other places / and peoples: yet forſomuche as / there ys in thoſe lawes a conſtant / and euerlaſting equitie / whereuppon they were grounded / and the ſame perfecter / and farther from error / then the forge off mans reaſon / (vvhich is euen in this behalffe / ſhre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wdly vvounded) is able to deuiſe: yt followeth / that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in making politike lawes / for the common wealth / Chriſtian Magiſtraites owght to propound vnto them ſelues thoſe lawes / and in light of their equitie / by a iuſt proportion off circunſtances off perſon / pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce / &amp;c. frame them.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore / that this equitie off the Iudiciall lawe / re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth not as a counſaile / vvhich men may followe yf they liſt / and leaue at their pleaſure / but as a lawe / vvhereunto they be

And this maintenance off the preiſtes / al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in the maner off prouiſion / yt was ceremoniall: yet as it was a reward of their ſeruice / due by men (as the puniſhementes alſo / iff they had failed in their duties) was mere iudiciall. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it is brought to paſſe / that in thoſe iudicialls / to all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances whereoff we are not bound: we are notwithſtanding bound to the equitie.</p>
                  <p>Yt remaineth to ſhewe / that there are certein Iudiciall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes / which can not be chaunged / as that a blaſphemer / contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous / and ſtubborne Idolater / &amp;c. ought to be put to death. The doctrine which leueth this at libertie / when they can alledge no cauſe off this looſenes / but the comming off our Sauiour Chriſt / and his paſſion / faulteth many wayes. And firſt / yt is a childiſhe error / to thincke that our Sauiour Chriſte came dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / to exempt men from corporall death / which the lawe caſteth vppon euill doers: when as he came not to deliuer from death / which is the parting off the bodie from the ſoule / but from that which is the ſeparation bothe off bodie / and ſoule / from the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious preſence off the lord. And iff it were ſo / that our Sa. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte had borne in his owne bodie / this ciuill puniſhement off pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike offenders: yt muſt folowe thereupon / not (which the Doctor Phanſieth) that <hi>it is in the libertie off the Magiſtrate, to put them to death:</hi> but that he muſt / will hee / nill he (yff they repent) kepe them aliue. For if our Sa. Chriſte hath anſwered that iuſtice off God in his lawe / whereby he hath commaunded / that ſuche malefactors
<pb n="XCIX" facs="tcp:7985:66"/> ſhould be put to death: yt ſhould be great iniuſtice / to require that againe / in the life off the offender. So that ether our Sa.

                  <p>Againe / this opinion ys iniurious vnto the death / and wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ole appearing / off the ſonne of God in fleſhe. For where he appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for this cauſe / that he might deſtroy ſinne / which is the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But pardon me / I thinke I ſee yowr difference / which is / that the Iewes muſte doo yt accordinge to the lawe off Moſes / and the Chriſtians accordinge to the lawe off whome? why kepte yow backe that? Surely iff the Chriſtians be bounde to doo yt (as yowr interpretation ſaythe) they are bounde to doo yt by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we off Moſes: for I knowe no other lawe off preceptes / but that.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another difference / whiche yowr wordes maye gyue ſuſpicion off: that is / that the Chriſtian parentes ſhoulde ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put them to deathe / then be withdrawne by them: ſo that the Iewes haue a ſymple commaundemente to put them to deathe / but the Chriſtians haue yt vnder condition / yf they can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe kepe ſtill the trewe worſhippe off God.

Thes differences betwene his interpretacions he giueth incklinge off / but the folye off them was ſo apparante / that he durſte not laye them open.</p>
                  <p>And althowge vve haue alredy to manye interpretations by one: yet here comethe the thirde. And this is an allegorie / whiche expoundeth <hi>killinge, <hi>confutinge.</hi>

Whether the Archedeacon haue the examination committed vntho him onely: I referre me vnto the booke off ordering mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters / and to that whiche I haue before alledged.

                  </hi> yt ſhall be ſeene / how trwly yow haue ſpoken. For the declaration wheroff / I take the 10. verſe off that chap. For when S.

Whereupon I conclude / that if that place commaunde Timothe / that he ſhoulde not applie any to the miniſterie / before triall: the ſame implieth / that he ſhould trie them. for ſo muche as any other mans triall withowt his owne / is no triall wherupon he might proceede / to the applyinge of them to the miniſtery: eſpecially conſidering that otherwiſe / he ſhould offend againſt that which he forbiddeth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22.</note> place / off ſodeine laying on of handes. And if it be ſaid / that it is to be vnderſtanded of the deacons: the anſwere is that iff he commaunde that off the deacons election / muche more he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe it in the Biſhops.

                  </hi> I aſke him wherin? In that forſoothe I therby conclude / that the biſhop ſhould be the examiner. where did I euer denie it? But if he thinke any thinge grow vnto the lord biſhops / or that therfore the biſhopp alone may examine and ordeine / becauſe I graunt that he hathe intereſt in booth he hathe ouercaſt / the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is not ſo great. To ſhew that the ſame owght to be the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners / that are the chuſers / it is ſufficient to haue ſhewed it in one: the law beinge the ſame in all / which is in one.

               <p>Therfore the anſwere is / that that meanes vvhich the Biſhop may vſe / before he is Miniſter for his triall: that alſo may the church.

               <p>Ther remaineth onely / whether to take knowledge off him / <hi>he ſhoulde come dwell with the pariſhe, and how longe, and at whoſe charges, and whether before the death off the former paſtor, or after.</hi> Yf I ſhould ſaie / that the iourney he taketh to the biſhopp / he ſhould beſtowe in goinge to the pariſhe / and be amongeſt them / vvhat vvoulde follow? then he muſt be there a great while / or euer they can haue triall off him / and <hi>therby grow charges.</hi> As who ſhould ſaie / the vvhole church can not take as good notice off him / as the biſhop being but one: or as thowghe the biſhop can take better knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge off his conuerſation in one houre / then the vvhole church can doo in one weeke.

               <p>I ſaye that one that hathe bene an adulterer / ſhould not be receiued into the miniſterie: I proue it / for that S.

               <p>The firſt off your reaſons / to proue that <hi>a knowen adulterer may be receiued into the miniſterie:</hi> is <hi>that S.

               <p>But <hi>Chriſt knewe Iudas to be a traytor, and yet he did not depoſe him:</hi> ſo he knewe him to be a traitor / when he choſe him.

               <p>And vvhere as he ſaith / <hi>that he which is aſſured off an inward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, need not to doubte of his owtward:</hi> yow ſhould vnderſtand that the aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the inward calling / depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth a great parte of the owt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. for allbeyt the ſprite of God worketh that aſſurance: yet he worketh by the owtward means of the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the elders / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d off the church / touching his aptnes for the miniſtrie: whileſte he conſidereth / that that calling is not the calling off men / but off God throwgh the miniſterie of men. Nether is there any one (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepe thoſe vvhich are called extraordinaryly) vvhich can haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance off any inward calling / but by the means off owtwarde. For if he were aſſured that God had called him / without the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off men; he owght to obey his voice / althowgh men would

The D. deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this ſtoutly.

Laſt off all / wherin (lieth a great weight of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie) he dooth not ſaie ſimply / that this forme off choiſe by the church is vnmeete / and inconuenient for this age off he churche: but that it coulde not be by and by / and out of hand reſtored: and after a litle / that it could not be in al churches / by and by reſtored.

               <p>Vnto this queſtion off election / and ordination belongeth the 2. chapter of the 4. tract. of ceremonies in ordeining: off wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich the 2.

/ conſidering that Saincte Luke / purſuing the leſte of thoſe ceremonies which were vſed / made no mencion off it / being in the D. iudgement / worthieſt off all other to be followed.

               <p>Where he ſaith / that <hi>Chriſte commaundinge the ſea to be quiet, and breathing vppon his diſciples, confirmed his diuinitie:</hi> I anſwer that he did the ſame / in commaunding to receiue the holy goſte / which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he woulde haue praied for / as at other times when he gaue teſtimonie off his humanitie.

If in the generall ſignification / for that they are ſent to preach: yt maketh nothing to the queſtion / ſeing the D. muſt ſhewe that there is an ordinary particular function off Apoſtelſhip / ſeuered from the office off a Paſtor / Euangeliſt / and Prophete.

               <p>That I alledged the Apoſtels declaring <hi>that they vvould not haue this order continued in the church, in that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevved not that order of Apoſtels, as they vvere taken avvay by death:</hi> he anſwereth / firſt that <hi>the ſcripture doth not expreſſe it.</hi> As yf S.

                  <hi>Prophetes, and Apoſtels in ſuch reſpectes are ceaſſed, but continue ſtill</hi> as towching preaching the goſpell. Then which what can be more bluntly ſpoken? For yt as much as yf one ſhould ſay / that a beaſt is a man / although not in reſpect that it hath a naturall capacity off reaſon / and ſpeach: yet in that it liueth / and hath ſenſe as a man. For as a man / and a beaſt being both liuing thinges / are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered one from an other by their properties / and ſpeciall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences (as they be called off the Logicians): euen ſo Apoſt. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes / Euangeliſtes / Paſtors / Doctors / being all preachers off the Goſpell / are ſeuered by that wherein they differ / one from an other. And as he can be no man which hath none off thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences / whereby a man is ſeuered from other liuing thinges: ſo he can not be Prophete / or Apoſtel / which hath nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may differ / from a Paſtor / Doctor / or Euangeliſt. Yt is alſo too childiſhe / that he vnderſtandeth not how the difference off a thing (which is the ſubſtantiall forme) being taken away / the thing it ſelfe can not remaine.</p>
               <p>Therefore yf the D. will haue Apoſtels / Prophetes / and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes remaine: he muſt ſhew howe both euerie one off tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe / nowe differ from them ſelues / and from the functions off Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor / and Doctor. In which behalf he hath bene hacking / but his tooles will not enter.

               <p>Yea if he be miniſter off the whole church / he hath a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calling to preach in as many places / as he can poſſibly: as he which otherwiſe ſhalbe gilty off their bloud / ouer whom hauing a myniſtry / he hath doone no duty.

               <p>Then I anſwer / that although he could know where he might doo moſt good: yet that is no ſufficient calling off God.

In which for that he preached ſo often / and wrought ſo many miracles / yt is in an other place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his owne cyty. Now if our Sau.

For when he ſaithe / that <hi>S. Luke calleth kinges bountifull, in the ſame ſenſe that S.

Now yf the cyuill magiſtrate ſhould be the head off the church: he muſt be an vnder / and ſubordinat head off Chriſt.

Chriſt ſhould be a great king vpon earth: it is apparant that his anſwer / that he <hi>came to be a miniſter and to ſerue,</hi> was to ouerthrow that phantaſye of theirs. as if he ſhould ſay / yow looke to be Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vnder me / and I my ſelf came not to be a lord / or Prince: wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfore yowr deſyre of rule vnder me / is in vaine. And if this be the naturall ſenſe of thoſe wordes: then yt is manifeſt / that this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rd of miniſtring / being oppoſed vnto the ſtate of a Prince / this ſentence can by no meanes agree vnto ciuill magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>Further / when he calleth his diſciples to the imitacion of his ſeruice / and miniſtry (him ſelf being a miniſter of the goſpelly: it is cleare / that he ſpeaketh of ſuch a miniſtery / as can not agree vnto the ciuill magiſtrate. This may yet better appeare / by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iointes / or cleauinges knit vnto the myniſtery: which being ſuche as can not agree to the cyuill Magiſtrate / it followeth that thes wordes can not be vnderſtanded off both gouernementes. For our S.

If they be ſeuered in orders one from an other: that is not denied to be in officers off the church. If they exerciſe domynion one ouer an other: that is expreſſed in commen wealthes. So that if the Anſw. were able to proue all theſe / which will be hard for him withowt Denyſes dreames: yet he may ſee they conclude not a domynion / off one miniſter ouer an other.

Where yow ſay <hi>he muſt be expounded by thother Euangeliſtes:</hi> that can by no meanes be admitted. For it commeth often to paſſe in the greek toung / that compound verbes are put for ſimples: but that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples haue a compound ſignification / the vſe off that toung will not ſuffer. For the <hi>vſe off the word in the Actes, and S. Peter:</hi> beſide that
<pb n="CCCCXXXI" facs="tcp:7985:232"/> it is not ſtraunge for one word in ſcripture / to be taken diuerſly: that place maketh nothing to proue this ſignification. For what vvord ſoeuer S.

Therfore the peruerſenes off it / doth not appeare in the word / but in the ſubiect from whence it came.</p>
               <p>And if a man would make that word to ſignifie a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie / becawſe that rule was beyond meaſure: by the ſame reaſon the wordes Prince / Rule / Power / names off lawfull autoritie / ſhould be condemned: For that a ſcribed vnto Deuills / <note place="margin">

Peter kept the ſame diſtinction off gouernement off the ciuill Magiſtrate / and the Miniſter / which he had learned off our Sauiour Chriſt. For if he ment by that word / a dominion ſimply tirannicall: he vvould haue oppoſed yt vnto a moderate dominion / not as he did vnto being an example off the flock.

                  <hi>Christ doth not reproue thambition off his diſciples:</hi> vvhich is a manifeſt vntruth. For I ſay that he doth reproue it / and gyue alſo larger place to the reproofe off their ambition / then he. for vvhere he would haue it to <hi>conſiſt onely in that they ambitiously deſired to rule ouer their fellowes:</hi> I affirme that he did not onely take them vp for that / but alſo that they deſired to rule one ouer an other / which was not lawfull. Secondly he ſaith / I haue <hi>falſified his wordes, in that <hi>I</hi> father off him that our Sauiour reprehended onely thambition of his diſciples.</hi> vvhich I doo not / for my vvordes aſcribe vnto him that he ſaied / they vvere reproued not onely for deſire off rule / but for rule to oppreſſe. Then to maintein this quarrell / he affirmeth he ſaied / <hi>our Sauiour reproueth the tirannicall rule off kinges off the Gentills:</hi> as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wgh that made any thing to proue / that he did in his diſciples onely reproue ambition.

               <p>Moreouer he coulde not be ignorant by the courſe off diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation / that vvhen I ſaied / <hi>yf ambition onely vvere repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the diſciples:</hi> I ment <hi>that, if our S.

Thus partly with a manifeſt vntruth / partly with a trifling cauil / which (if it were true) maketh nether whoat / nor kold: it ſeemeth he would haue caſt a miſt before his readers eies / that he ſhould not ſee him giue the ſlip from my firſt argument in this diuiſ. For vnto this reaſon / <hi>that in that ſenſe off the place vvhich he</hi>

                  <hi>ſetteth dovvne, the anſvver off our Sauiour Chriſt ſhoulde not haue benefit: conſidering the Diſciples might haue replied, that he forbad tyrannicall rule of their inferiours, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred moderate, and vvell ruled gouernement:</hi> he anſwereth not a word. To his anſwer vnto the ſecond reaſon / <hi>that they are called bountifull, which haue no ſparck of bountifulnes:</hi> I replie that althowgh that may ſometimes come to paſſe / yet it ſhoulde haue bene owt of time / to haue made mention of it here in that ſenſe. For if as yow ſay / <hi>our Sauiour ſpeake here againſt the tirannie, and ambition of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> then it was owt off place to make mention off the flatterie off their ſubiectes / which call them by the title off <hi>bountifull.</hi> For that is rather the fault off the ſubiectes / then off the Princes. If yow ſay that they deſire that title: firſt the wordes off S. Luke doo not beare it owt: for he ſaith they are called gratious Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es / and not they deſire to be ſo called. Then it being a thing not ſimply vnlawfull / for a Prince to deſire to be called / and counted bountifull / to this end that by that fame men might be more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable: althowgh it ſhould be graunted to yow / that S. Luke ment that they deſire that title: yet foraſmuch as there is no ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne off ambition / or tirannie in that deſire / yow are ſtill behinde with yowr anſwer.</p>
               <p>For yowr example off the <hi>Pope called moſt holieſt, &amp;c.</hi> yt is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like. For men deceiued by error / call hym ſo: and althowgh they ſay vntruly / yet they ſpeake as they thinck / which can not be in this caſe, conſidering that no man can be abuſed by a falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion off his bountifulnes / which not onely giueth not / but is an oppreſſor. And although as there are found which knowing the wickednes off the Pope / call him notwithſtanding <hi>moſt holy:</hi> ſo there be vvhich knowing the illiberalitie off their Princes / call them notwithſtanding bountifull: yet yow ſhould haue conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red / that S. Luke ſpeaketh not here / how Princes are called off certein particular perſons: but by what titles they are called ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally / of all their ſubiectes. So that if yow would haue ſpokê to pourpoſe / yow ſhould haue ſhewed / that it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men thing for tyrantes / to be called generally of their ſubiectes whom they pill / bountifull: and that vvhich is harder for yow to doo / that
<pb n="CCCCXXXV" facs="tcp:7985:234"/> men will call miniſters bountifull / which giue nothing. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the interpretation vvhich yow imagine / hath no place.</p>
               <p>To my third reaſon / that <hi>it is not to be thovvght off all the Apoſtles, that they deſyred rule one ouer another, to the end they might vſe crueltie, and oppreſsion ouer their fellovves:</hi> he anſwereth not a vvord.

Therfore he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not in this allegorie follow their autoritie: but rather clean contrary / walketh herin in the Papiſtes ſteppes.

               <p>Yt is Calu. which reaſoneth of the place of the Epheſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / that <note place="margin">

For if it be graunted that the Popes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is therfore vnprofitable to the church / becawſe S.

The reaſon added / off the <hi>Pope doing thinges which thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chbiſhop doth not, claiming thinges which tharchbiſhop claimeth not, &amp;c.</hi> hath no place at all. for the queſtion is not off the abuſe / and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie off the Pope: but whether as it is vnprofitable that one ſhould gouerne all the churches in the world / ſo yt be alſo that he ſhould gouerne all in a whole prouince. And by the D. anſwer the office off Paſtors ſhould be vnlawfull / if they chalenge vnto them ſelues thinges vnlawfull: and the Popes office good / and lawfull / if he bearing rule ouer all churches / would abſteine from thoſe / and ſuch like chalenges which the Anſ. ſetteth downe. The contrary wheroff is true. For as the Paſtors office can by no ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trage of him that exerciſeth it / be made vnlawfull: ſo the vſage of dominion off one ouer all / be yt neuer ſo moderate / and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed can neuer be lawfull. Laſt of all / the Archbiſhop him ſelf / if he ſhould chalenge thoſe thinges in his prouince / which the Pope
<pb n="CCCCL" facs="tcp:7985:242"/> chalengeth ouer the world / ſhould be by this reaſon as vnla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wfull an officer as the Pope. Therfore this difference betwene the Archbiſhop / and Pope / being accidentall / and not towching the nature off the gouernement wheroff we haue to enquire / is vnſtilfully alledged.

               <p>The Anſ. concluſion off my replie / touching the place to the Epheſ. is euill ſhut vp. For where he ſaith <hi>that tharchbiſhoprick</hi>

                  <hi>may ſtand, becawſe that place reckening vp onely the miniſteries of the word, that is a miniſterie off order, and policie:</hi> how could he forget / that tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rchbiſhop medleth with the miniſterie of the word? and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neceſſarie to be here mentioned / if the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le had gyuen hym any place in the church.

But what is this vnto the Archbiſhop? let vs haue but one teſtimonie owt off the word off God off the office off an Archbiſhop / for the infinite teſtimonies off the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie of the ſonne of God: and then this example may help yow.

                     <hi>Diuiſ.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 4.</note> For this is Hardinges anſwer to the biſhop / that although the name of vniuerſall biſhop / was not at the firſt gyuen to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe: yet the autoritie was. After he flieth to his ould refuge of the Prince / and there ſeeketh couer for the Archbiſhop: aſking <hi>wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he ſhall haue no autoritie in the church, becawſe he was not in S.

Paul had ſaied that our Sauiour Chriſt had gyuen princes vnto his church immediatly after his aſcenſion / as he beareth vs in hand he gaue archbiſhops: ether they muſt haue had autoritie then / or neuer after. So keeping yowr ſimilitude / if our Sauiour gaue Archbiſhops when he aſcended / and in S. Paules time: ether they muſt haue had their autoritie then / or neuer after. And the caſe is nothing like. for if there were no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes in the Apoſtles times / they being needfull for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
<pb n="CCCCLIIII" facs="tcp:7985:244"/> off the churches: the cawſe was that it was not in the Apoſtles power / to ordein Chriſtian Princes. But it was in their power to haue prouided the churches off Archbiſhops / if they had bene needfull: and therfore they had bene inexcuſable for not appointing them / ſeruing ſo greatly to the building off the church / as we are borne in hand.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the compariſon is moſt vnfitly made: ſeing the cyuill magiſtrate is a perpetuall office for all times / perſones / pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: wheras by his owne confeſſion / the Archbiſop is temporall / and arbitrarie. Where alſo he aſketh <hi>whether the ciuill Magiſtrate ſhall not haue the cheif autoritie in gouerning the church, becauſe there ys no expreſſe mention off him in thes two places:</hi> I anſwer that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces autoritie is eſtabliſhed in other places / ſo that it may floriſh withowt thes.

               <p>Laſtly yow ſay <hi>the adminiſtration off diſcipline, and gouernement in the Apoſtles, is fallen vpon the Archbiſhops, and biſhops, the ouerthrow off my whole aſſertion</hi> Yf a man will belieue yow ſpeaking / he may: oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe here is nothing but <hi>I <hi>ſaied yt.</hi>

For before yow haue ſaied once / or twiſe <hi>that the office, and autoritie off an Archbiſhop was in the Apoſtles tymes.</hi> Which if yt be true / how doth the Archbiſhop receiue his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auritie off order / and gouernement by their death? for hauing yt before / he cannot receiue yt by their departure. Ether ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is vntrue / that the archbiſhop exerciſeth the ſame auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which the Apoſtles: or that which yow ſaied before / that the office off the Archbiſhop was in the Apoſtles time: or els this third is true / that he hauing in the Apoſtles time / autoritie which he hath now: by their death obteined beſide their former autoritie / that which the Apoſtle had alſo. Which how neere it
<pb n="CCCCLVIII" facs="tcp:7985:246"/> pricketh at the papacye / I leaue to euery one to conſider.

               <p>In that ſenſe which I haue ſhewed in an other place / I <note place="margin">

                  </note> graunt it true which Ierome ſaith / <hi>that all biſhops ſuccede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Apoſtles:</hi> but ſhew me who ſpeaketh any thing off the ſucceſſion off the archbiſhop vnto them. Nay verily that is flat againſt the archbiſhops autoritie. For if euery biſhop haue that autoritie in his church / which the Apoſtles had in all the world: it followeth that there nether needeth / nether can be any archbiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop to receiue any theroff. And that if any archbiſhop chalenge a greater autoritie / then is in any one biſhop: he pulleth to him ſelf greater autoritie in his prouince / then euer the Apoſtles had in the world. And by the ſame reaſon that they be Lordes / and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours ouer biſhops: they muſt be lordes / and ſuperiours in th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eir prouince ouer the Apoſtles them ſelues / if they were aliue. Conſidering they rule ouer thoſe / which in their dioceſes haue the ſame autoritie that the Apoſtles had. This I ſpeake / not that I thinck the Biſhops had not this autoritie / from the very birth / and foundacion off the function / as towching the gouernement off their churches / or that there came any autoritie vnto them by the Apoſtles death / which they had not in their tymes: but that yt may be vnderſtanded / that if there were any ſuch ſucceſſion vnto the Apoſtles gouernement / as the D. phanſieth: the biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops are the right beyres / and that not certein (other ſome ſhut forth) but euery one as Ierome ſaith. Although if tharchbiſhop ſhould haue an Apoſtolicall autoritie in gouerning his prouince: it hath appeared / and more ſhall (God willing) that the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les gouernement was far from that principalitie / and rule one ouer an other / which tharchbiſhops chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ouer their vnder bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. The next diuiſion I will not anſwer. The next vnto that / I report me to the reader / whether I haue faithfully / and allmoſt ſeruilely bound my ſelf vnto his wordes / in tranſlating thes pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his latin pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phlet. For the next alſo / I hauing ſhewed that yow placing the Apoſtles function in preaching / and miniſtring

Howbeit aſhamed to ſpeake it in ſo many wordes / euen yet the courſe off this treatiſe doth breath nothing els.</p>
               <p>This is no anſwer vnto my reaſon. For if the church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diuiſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Pag.</hi> 313.</note> the Archbiſhop / and Archdeacon / be a bodie conſiſting of all the partes / comely knit together / wherin nothing wanteth / nor nothing is to much: then it followeth / that thes offices bring ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ornement / nor accompliſhement to the church / but make on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ely an vnprofitable knob / and lump off fleſh / to the both diſfugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring / and hinderance off the growght off the bodie. And the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie off order / and policie of the church / being one part off this bodie: if it be not whole / and complete / but need to be peeced owt with archbiſhops / and Archdeacons: it muſt draw with it this abſurditie / that there being one member vnperfect withowt them / the bodie alſo off Chriſt is not perfecte. And where it ys ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied / <hi>that as in the Apoſtles times the church was not perfect withowt them, and Prophetes, &amp;c. ſo it is not now,</hi> meaning therby (as both befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re / and after hath appeared) that tharchbiſhops ſhould ſupplie the roume off the Apoſtles: I anſwer that the Argument holdeth not. For conſidering that the perfection off the bodie / muſt be meaſured by the will off him whoſe the bodie is / that is Chriſt: as when he gaue Apoſtles / Euangeliſtes / &amp;c. he made it appeare that he would not haue his bodie perfect withowt them: ſo wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en he tooke them away from his church / he made it knowen that the bodie was perfect withowt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yf Apoſtles / and Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes had bene put downe by autoritie of man: then yt might haue helped yow / that as men put downe Myniſteries / ſo they might ſupplie them with other. But ſeing they were taken away by the Lord: this yowr reaſon in effect <hi>(becawſe God taketh away, therfore men may adminiſteries)</hi> hath no ſtrenght in it. And where all this drift is / that yow vvould haue tharchbiſhops office come in for the Apoſtles / and therfore ſay <hi>that their autoritie ouer the paſtors doth, and muſt remaine in ſuch places, as there be churches:</hi> beſides my former anſwer vnto this point / yow are againe taken in the wordes off
<pb n="CCCCLX" facs="tcp:7985:247"/> yowr owne lippes. For if it <hi>muſt remaine:</hi> then the office off the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chbiſhop which yow make the veſſell to receiue this autoritie in / and whoſe office (yow ſay) <hi>conſiſteth in the rule off other paſtors,</hi> is not variable / and depending off circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance off time / &amp;c. but perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all / and conſtant.</p>
               <p>Yf Bucer ſpeake as yow make him: I can by no meanes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vnto him. For S. Luke ſaith plainly / that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">

Luke. And if the name off biſhop doth vnproperly belong vnto thoſe / whom Saint Paul ſaith <hi>the holy goſt</hi> had <hi>appointed biſhops: ouer the church:</hi> I confeſſe that I can not tell what autoritie is ſufficient / to make that name off biſhop proper vnto them. And if the name off biſhop did not properly belong vnto them all / but vnto one onely: yt followeth that the name alſo of an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der / did not properly belong vnto them. For the one of them ys <note place="margin">

And how is this ſentence off Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer here pulled in by the heare? for albeit it were concluded / that one biſhop ſhould beare dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer the miniſters of one chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: yet yt followeth not which is here in queſtion / that one alſo owght to rule ouer all biſhops in a prouince.

Wheras the maner of writers is / when they alledge any thinge that the former times had not ſpoken off / as at the finding of ſome greate treaſure / to note the meanes how that fell into their handes.</p>
               <p>Againſt the autoritie alledged owte off Euſebius / that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys was biſhop / is oppoſed that it is <hi>a negatiue argument of autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:</hi> which is an engine to wringe owte off the churches handes / a ſingular meanes which all the writers of our times / vſe againſte the forgeries off the Papiſtes. For when they reaſon againſt the forged Epiſtles / againſte Chriſoſtomes leytourgie / againſt the baſtard writinges of Auguſtine / &amp;c. that there are thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in them which no writer of that age wherein they are ſuppoſed to haue writte / maketh mention off; the D. hath tawght an eaſie anſwer / that yt is an euill argument off autoritie negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely / and that yt followeth not that there were no ſuche thinges then / becawſe they were not mentioned in their writinges. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when the biſhop of Saliſ. made this chalenge after perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med / that yt coulde not be ſhewed owt off any alowed writer 600. Yeares after Chriſte / that there was any mention off ſuche / and ſuche thinges mainteined by poperie: the Anſw. hath with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne worde / wiped awaie the profite off all thoſe trauailes. for yt maie be anſwered / that ſuche thinges were / althowghe none made mencion of them. The Papiſtes in their defences haue har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de foreheades: but I thincke there is ſcarce founde amongeſte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / that would not bluſhe at ſuche an anſwer. Yet this is alm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſt the ſalue for all ſores / namely where I haue ſhewed / that in
<pb n="CCCCLXXVIII" facs="tcp:7985:256"/> none of the writers within certeine hundred yearés after Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſte / which haue filled their bookes vvith the mention of biſhops / there is any the leaſte mention of an Archbiſhop. Againſte which ryot off anſwer oftentimes repeted / yt ſhall be ſufficiente once here to haue ſpoken generally.</p>
               <p>Now I come to that more proper to this place / that <hi>hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are not ſo curious in calling men by their ſeuerall tytles: becauſe we vſe to call the biſhops of Canturbery, and Yorke, oftener by name of biſhop then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chbiſhop.</hi> But he ſhould vnderſtand / that yt is one thing to ſpeake after the commen ſort: and an other to write to the approbation of the learned. And when there ys no kinde of writing ſo narro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wly bound to the obſeruation of circumſtances off place / time / perſon / as a ſtorie: yt muſt bring a great miſt in it / to put no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene a biſhop / and an Archbiſhop: conſidering that that perteineth to the policie off the church / vvherunto they had reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. So that althowgh he vſe ſome libertie off ſpeach in other places: yet in this place yt was more inſufferable / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually / in Denys twiſe / in Iames / in the biſhop of Rome / of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria / &amp;c. he might withowt reprehenſion haue ſpoken ſo once / or twiſe: but him perpetually to call all Archbiſhops biſhops / I thinck yow vvill hardly perſwade any man off iudgement. And if there had bene any ſuch titles allowed: yt would haue appeared in the ſuperſcriptions off biſhops to archbiſhops. At leaſt the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer degrees off Deacons / and Elders would haue acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it / as both dutie / and honeſt ciuilitie requireth: otherwiſe if the archbiſhops had bene froward / they would not haue red the letters. But not Euſebius onely / Denys the Biſhop / who wrote vnto the church off Athenes / ſo called him euen in that place / wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere <note place="margin">

               <p>Furthermore if Euſebius had ſpoken ſo vnproperly: he is yet to be charged with further confuſion. For he aſſigneth hym a pariſh / which is a territorie belonging vnto a ſimple biſhop: and not a prouince / which is an archbiſhops kingdom. Yf therfore he confounded archbiſhop with biſhop: at leaſt he ſhould haue ſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oken
<pb n="CCCCLXXIX" facs="tcp:7985:256"/> dinſtinetly off their charges. Laſt off all / how idle a phariſie this is off Deniſes archbiſhoprick / may be conſidered foraſmuch as Euſeb. in both places by me alledged / calleth him the firſt bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop off Athenes. And that he was firſt in thoſe partes may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely be ſeene / for that it was the wiſdome of the holy goſt / to ſettle firſt the Goſpell in the mother townes / and head places of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: that from thence it might haue paſſadge to places rownd about / as the practiſe in the Actes doth declare. Now if he were the firſt biſhop choſen after the conuerſion of Athenes: by the D. ſaying he was made Archbiſhop / before there were any other biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops to ouerſee. But foraſmuch as tharchbiſhop is in the nombre of thoſe vvhich hang of other / and that there could be no archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop vvhere there were no biſhops / nor biſhop where there we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re no churches rownd about: it is browght to paſſe / that there being no biſhops in thoſe partes / at that time vvhen Saint Paul ordeined Denys biſhop: he can by no meanes be thowght to haue ordeined him archbiſhop. And that vvhich I haue ſaied in this point againſt the archbiſhoprick off Denis (the laſt onely excepted) is to be vnderſtanded off Iames / Titus / Timothe / &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yf a ſpade be but a ſpade / and a fig but a fig: then a biſhop is but a biſhop. Then alſo Eraſmus ſaying (alledged pag. 405.) <note place="margin">

But it is good to obſerue by the vvay / how the Anſ. building vvith one hand / ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erthroweth vvith the other.

               <p>The reaſons wherby he would bring ſome credit vnto thes canons / are to light.

               <p>Yow ſaie yow <hi>agree with the biſhop off Salisbury in his reply aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſte Harding touching the canon he alledgeth.</hi> The trwth is that you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue done the beſte yow can / to ouerthrowt the whole defenſe off the biſhop in that behalfe: vvhich ſtandeth in profe that thoſe be counter faicte / and that there were no other canons off the Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne councell / then are commonly extant.

<pb n="CCCCXCIX" facs="tcp:7985:266"/> vniuerſall biſhop / offred in the Councell off Calcedon vnto the biſhop of Rome. For if Rome deſired not that title / yea refuſed it offered: then there was no ſuch cauſe off the decree off the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Councells / to bridle it in the title off vniuerſall biſhop. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly this expoſition bringeth manifeſte force to the councells wordes.

               </p>
               <p>Now let vs ſee his reaſons. The firſt is / <hi>Celeſtinus biſhop of Rome, claimed the hearing of matters in the Africane churches, as appeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th by the Africane Councell</hi> But how doth he not ſee that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell off Carthage / the Canon wheroff I alledged / was before that councell? His anſwer therfore is / that the Councell off Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage by way off Propheceye / decreed againſt the ambition off Celeſtinus / not then biſhop. And althowgh this be abſurd / yet that which followeth is yet more: that this canon ſhould be <hi>to prouide againſte the ambition of the biſhop of Conſtantinople,</hi> which chalen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged the name off vniuerſall biſhop / about two hundred year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es after this canon made.

<pb n="DI" facs="tcp:7985:267"/> in the wordes alledged by the D. nor any other off that Councell doth it appeare / that the Biſhop off Rome claimed the title off v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall biſhop. But as Iulius biſhop off Rome had doon at the Councell off Antioch / he owtreached in claiming the hearing off cawſes / which perteined not vnto him. In which reſpect the Councell made a ſpeciall chapter / that whoſoeuer ſhould appeale beyond the ſeas / ſhould not be receiued into communion off any in Africk.

For the Biſhop off Rome in reſpect of the three other Patrigrckes / was firſt: yet not their Archbiſhop / but onely had the firſt place in their meetinges. Eſpecially ſeing the Councell doth flatly forbid / that the firſt biſhop amongeſt them ſhould be called by that name / but onely biſhop off the firſt ſeate. For that owt of maiſter Fox / <hi>that thes names Archbiſhop, &amp;c. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not forbidden by this canon:</hi> I refer the reader to his owne worck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es / with this remembrance that I haue ſhewed in the former booke / how Maiſter Fox counteth thes <hi>degrees ambicious.</hi> As for <hi>the name high prieſt owt of Ignatius:</hi> if need were it may be ſhewed both by reaſons / and autoritie / that he is not off that auncientie the D. ſuppoſeth.

                  <p>The firſt that euery particular church ſhould haue her biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop / is manifeſt by Paul to Timothe.

And if he ment that: he is far ſhort of his reckening: nether is it made vp by his third note / which I thinck tendeth to the ſame end. For where it ſeemeth that by thes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>(and good men)</hi> he would haue it thowght there were oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er people beſide the cytiſens off Rome / at Cornelius election: the wordes are / <hi>of auncient prieſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and good men in the colledge:</hi> referring the word <hi>colledge,</hi> to good men / as wel as to prieſtes.

                  <p>Before I come to Ieromes teſtimonie / the order off tymes for the better vnderſtanding off this cauſe / requireth that thoſe bothe autorities / and examples be anſwered / which the Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hath alledged / bothe before / owte off the Councell off Nice and Antioche / and after / pa. 470. &amp;c.

Then / yt ys not ſaide (as he reporteth) that <hi>all the churches of Pentapolis were vnder his iuriſdiction:</hi> but onely <hi>that he had care of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe churches,</hi> or (as the tranſlators words be) <hi>the care of thoſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches apperteined vnto him.</hi> Which what litle or no weighte they haue to proue archiepiſcopall iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſhall be ſeene when we come to the place / where the ſenſe of this <hi>to haue care,</hi> ys di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuſſed. In the meane time yt is to be obſerued for better triall of this matter / which I haue before noted owte of Euſebius: that he ſucceded in the biſhoprick off Alexandria vnto his predeceſſor / withowte attributing vnto hym any further charge. And when as Euſeb. declareth / that he writing vnto the churches in Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / wrote vnto them by the bare name of <hi>the brethren vvhich vvere in Aegypte,</hi> withowte any title betokening anie bonde / or knot off myniſterie towardes them: and off the other parte wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">

                  <p>And the very teſtimonie which the Anſ. hathe alledged / yf yt be weighed: dothe ſufficiently declare how farre Dionyſius
<pb n="DLIX" facs="tcp:7985:297"/> was / front that antoritie euer the churches off Pentapolis / wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich he imagineth. For there ys ſhewed / bow when he vnderſtoode off certeine biſhops there / leauened with the hereſie of Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: he ſente meſſengers to them to <hi>call them backe from their hereſie.</hi> And when they wente yet forwarde <hi>more impudently:</hi> what iuriſdiction doothe he exerciſe againſte them? doothe he cauſe them to appeare before him? ſend owt the ſentence off ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication / remoue them from their charges / ſuſpende them / at the leaſte vntill ſome triall off their amendement? none off all thes: but ſaith / <hi>he vvas by this ſtubbernes off theirs, compelled to vvrite againſte them.</hi> And yet if Dionyſius might haue vſed this autoritie / he woulde no dowbte: and if he had / Athanaſius would by no meanes haue let it paſſe. For if he could haue alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged / that Dionyſius had ether depoſed / ſuſpended / or excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated thoſe Sabellian biſhops: yt had bene a ſingular meanes to haue ſtopped the mouthe off the Arrians: which woulde haue borne men in hande / that Dionyſius fauored Sabellius hereſie / and conſequently alſo theirs.

Yt is greate merueill if he kepe good order in the church / for whoſe eſtabliſhement the Anſw. is conſtreined / thus to confound / and make a broile off all: and it is before confuted.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit admitting that the biſhops ſuccede vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtels in preaching the word / and gouerning the church: I haue <note place="margin">

For what biſhops haue better right to ſuccede the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les / then they? But thoſe were (as I haue ſhewed) biſhops off ſingular congregations / biſhops which had no ſuperiotitie ouer their fellowbiſhops / as Ierome doth confeſſe. In the end he ſaith / <hi>If I can proue by good autoritie, that one was gouernour amongeſt the</hi> 12. <hi>Apoſtles: it ſhall not ſeme ſtrange to haue an archbiſhop ouer a Prouince.</hi> If vpon this that one had gouernement of 12. aſſembled in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place / he can conclude that there ſhould be one gouernour off the miniſters in a Prouince: I can with better reaſon conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="DLXXIII" facs="tcp:7985:306"/>
/ that there may be one to gouerne all the miniſters in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lde.

The D. therfore muſt forgoe one off thes / ſeing that both will neuer drawe in one forowgh. The <hi>contrarietie with my ſelf,</hi> which the gloſſe chargeth me with / is for that pag. 349.

                  <p>The Anſw. would gird vp his Archbiſhop in ſmaller rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me / that he might ſeme les growen owt off faſchion. He ſaith <note place="margin">

So the ſumme off this anſwer is / the Archbiſhop may not determin the matter at his pleaſure / but according to the word off God. As thowgh the queſtion were / by what rule controuerſies ſhould be decided: and not by whom. For when the controuerſie at Antioch was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Apoſtles / &amp;c. in Ieruſalem: it was not permitted vnto them otherwiſe to iudge off it / then according to the word.

                     </gap> the ſwelling autoritie off the Archbiſhop / I alledge that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies / <hi>yt is not permitted to any one to determin vvhat is the vvill off God in that behalf.</hi> The D. ſaith / <hi>the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop muſt determin by the word off God.</hi> As thowgh if the matter had bene committed to S.

And if he think more ſuccour for him in the wordes he vſed / <hi>the archbiſhop muſt determin according to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of the church:</hi> it is certein alſo that the companie of Apoſtles / and Elders in Ieruſalem / and what companie ſoeuer meeteth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abowt the ending of ſuch matters / is ſubiect vnto all lawful and commendable orders off the churche / prouided for the more orderly proceding in that behalf.

                  <p>The two firſt ſections how ſhamefullie they be ſaid / I leaue to the readers iudgement: in the laſt / againſt that I alledged owt off the Scoliaſte / that Paule would not haue one rule the whole Ile / and therfore not Titus: is browght firſt an expoſition gone abowte to be confirmed off him / and Chryſoſtome / which ſay <hi>that Paule committed vnto Titus Crete, and to Timothie almoſte all Aſia.</hi> As yf that might not well ſtand with that / <hi>that Titus gouerned one citie alone.</hi> for in that they had autoritie giuen them / to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point miniſters in forme aforeſaid / in all that circuite / vntill the churche there were fully eſtabliſhed / and a lawfull miniſterie thr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owghly planted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there charge in that reſpecte / extended yt ſelfe to that whole circuite. But when the countrey was deuided into ſeuerall churches / and euery churche had a lawfull / and complete miniſtery: he charge before generall / is now reſtrained vnto that one churche where Titus made his abode. Euen as euerie off the 12. Princes / and Aaron which deuided the land off Canaan / had before partition a certein power off all: which after lottes caſt had onely to do with that / which apperteined to them in ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. A thowgh yf yt be graunted that Titus and Timothe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued that large gouernement / during their abode there / whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin I will not ſtriue): yet conſidering as hathe bene ſhewed they were Euangeliſtes / and no Biſhops / nor Archbiſhops: there can nothing grow to them hereby. For as no man can haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement ouer all the churches which the Apoſtels had / but they that haue that ſpeciall office: ſo none can ſuccede into the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction off Euangeliſtes / but they onely which haue that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie miniſterie.

For their Synagoges being the ſame that our particular churches / in euery one off them being not one / but many princes: the vrging off that example / bringeth diuers cheif gouernours / or archbiſhops in euery particular church. Then he ſaith / <hi>one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian commen wealth is but one church,</hi> which is vntrue. For firſt alth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owgh the church be in a Chriſtian commen wealth: yet nether is the commen wealth the church / nor the church the commen we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aith as ſhall appeare. Beſides / I haue ſhewed that the ſcripture (off whoſe manner off ſpeach the queſtion is) vſeth not to call a Prouince / or dioces / a church: but ether the whole vniuerſall / or els a particular congregation. Thirdly if it were ſo / yet the anſw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is inſufficient.

He ſaith / <hi>the ſuperioritie amongeſt the prieſtes: and Leuites, is by the ciuill law of Moſes.</hi> Which declareth him rauiſhed off all iudgement: it being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that they were ether Ceremoniall / or Eccleſiaſticall lawes / wherwith the Lord diſpoſed of the degrees of the miniſterie: wherof the Ceremoniall being aboliſhed / and therfore the chieftie off one prieſt ouer all / we willingly reteine the eccleſiaſticall.</p>
               <p>Where to that alledged off <hi>Princes off the families off Leuites,</hi> I replied <hi>that the Lord vvoulde by thoſe titles as by liuely pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, imprint in the Ivves vnderſtanding the chieftie off our S.

<pb n="DCXXXVIII" facs="tcp:7985:339"/> that thoſe that would conclude therof / one chief / now amongeſt the miniſters in a Prouince / are therby put to ſilence.

And if my anſw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er like him not he ſhall haue the biſhops / as litle for his aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which ſaith: <hi>The Prince of the families doth not ſignifie</hi>
